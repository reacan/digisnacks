## Haters vs. Innovators
A week ago the newly appointed minister of culture of Latvia Ms.Agnese Logina gave an [interview](https://satori.lv/article/seit-mes-cinamies-par-galvam-saruna-ar-kulturas-ministri-agnesi-loginu) where she emphasized the need to redefine patriotism in order to promote a more inclusive society, a society where the feeling of belonging transcends ethnic characteristics, where people should find a sense of home and acceptance irrespective of their cultural background. 

However, Ms.Logina's visionary call to redefine patriotism in the pursuit of a more inclusive society was met with harsh and unfounded criticism. These critics were seemingly out of touch with the global discourse on successful post-nationalism concepts. 

In 2012, I became acquainted with several interesting post-nationalism concepts. I would like to share an updated excerpt from an essay I wrote back then, discussing a concept with a particularly interesting backstory.

## Constitutional Patriotism

The concept of constitutional patriotism, originally coined by German philosophers Karl Jasper and his scholar Dolf Sternberger in the post-WWII period and later adopted by Jurgen Habermas, aimed to replace the notion of “conventional patriotism” ‒ where national identity plays the most crucial role.

### German national identity

Constitutional patriotism played a vital role in constructing a German national identity, a task fraught with complexities after the traumas of the Second World War. This concept advocates that a sense of belonging to a community should not be based on ethnic principles or a shared history but on common values and norms.

A shining example of constitutional patriotism, as highlighted by Habermas and later emphasized by Muller, can be found in the Federal Republic of Germany. Here, patriotism is not rooted so much in historical identities as in rights and democratic procedures (Muller, 2006, p. 288).

Constitutional patriotism amalgamates elements of both cosmopolitanism and communitarianism. It acknowledges the emotional attachment as a crucial resource in democratic politics, drawing from communitarianism. However, it vehemently rejects communitarianism’s exclusionary traits. In this context, the community is viewed as a valuable resource but only if it is inclusive, not exclusive. It borrows from cosmopolitanism the idea that democratic procedures can bridge the deficits in social integration.

### World of Tomorrow

Constitutional patriotism stands as a cornerstone in post-national democratic frameworks due to its inherently inclusive nature. In a world where diversity is celebrated and global cooperation is essential, this concept serves as a beacon of hope. By embracing common values and democratic principles, societies can foster unity without compromising individual identity. It paves the way for a harmonious coexistence where differences are celebrated, not feared. In essence, constitutional patriotism offers a blueprint for a more interconnected and empathetic global community, where the bonds that tie us together are based on shared ideals and mutual respect.
