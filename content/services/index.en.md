#### Full computer disk images, collections of files, or scattered documents:

I can help you make sense of it all. Using advanced open source data analysis [tool](https://iped.dev), I create a custom, portable interface for you to search, filter, and explore your information.

Whether you're looking for keywords, specific file types, or metadata like document creators, camera makes and models. The interface is designed with simplicity in mind, so you can quickly navigate through your data and find exactly what you need, without technical headaches.

#### Some of my clients' use cases:

* An analysis interface for a computer disk image of a laptop;
* An analysis interface for a directory containing various files;
* An analysis application running on a virtual server that processes a network share containing mailbox files (_.pst_) at set intervals;
* An analysis application running on a workstation that the client uses to regularly process large volumes of archive files (_.zip_, _.7z_, _.rar_, etc.) containing text documents, spreadsheets, pictures, and other types of data.
