<div style="text-align: justify;">
Greetings, my name is Dāvis and this is my corner on the World Wide Web, welcome! 
<br>
<br>
Over the past couple of years, my professional journey has been quite a ride. I've shifted from people-oriented roles to tech-focused positions and <i>vice versa</i>. My adventurous spirit has taken me to places most folks would steer clear of, all driven by ideals and a hunger for experience.
<br>
<br>
I am passionate about all things information technology, it specially UNIX-like operating systems, information security, and data/information analysis. I am always open to interesting projects and collaborations.
<br>
<br>
Feel free to reach out by sending a message to: <a href=mailto:hello@dvilcans.com>hello@dvilcans.com</a>
