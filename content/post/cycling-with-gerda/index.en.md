Gerda is a natural born marathon runner, it is one of her favorite things to do. She can run in this pace without stopping for about 7 kilometers straight. I only pedal the bike when we have to go uphill or when the terrain gets difficult. 

###### She behaves herself precisely like Vinny

Found this video on Telegram the other day.
