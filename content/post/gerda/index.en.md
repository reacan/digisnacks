### Yo, what's good to all my peeps who care 'bout [my destiny](https://eng.lsm.lv/article/society/society/29.09.2023-latvian-radio-investigation-involves-dog-homeless-man-gas-station-animal-shelter-billionaire.a525652/)!

It's been a little over a year since I've been rollin' with this fam. Back then, rollin' into the big green yard, I was kinda scared of all that space and freedom, but my two-legged crew was all hype, encouragin' me to explore the yard. 

Start was tough for all of us, filled with challenges, but they pushed me to explore, told me to trust, and every day through their actions, they showed me how wanted and loved I am.

### I'm taken on walks to the sea or the forest EVERY DAY! 

I learned to run alongside when the fam's rollin' on wheels, got tons of gear, some I've worn out on sunny days. Mama says it's a habit from my old days. 

I get to crash wherever I want, sometimes irritate my people a bit, sleepin' right in the middle of the doorway, makin' them step over me.

I'm the physical activity queen in the fam, keepin' them in shape. I got a horse. Used to be all majestic, now kinda skinny, but that's my stress ball! When I'm too hyped, so hyped that joy's burstin' out of me, I grab my horse in my teeth and show everyone how aware I am. 

Sometimes I lose control and jump with the horse right onto my human, hopin' to land on their lap. Sometimes it works. I can jump real high.

### I got a brother too. 

Didn't expect to deal with this furball, but I see he makes these people happier, so I haven't devoured him yet. Others, though, I would, 'cause this is my turf and I guard it carefully. 

I chase cars down the street, even made a sand path there, escort suspicious folks with a deep growl. People appreciate my voice, so I ain't shy 'bout showin' it off once in a while.

I still get scared of loud noises – thunder or fireworks – then I hide in the fireplace or the basement. My people had to give me lots of love and encouragement so I wouldn't be afraid of ridin' in cars. At first, I thought they wanted to take me back. Turns out, we were just goin' to the sea. 

Slowly got used to the fact that cars ain't a threat. I can politely wait and see off the car, even if they don't take me with them.

### Mama says love heals all wounds. 

I had quite a few when I got here, but the visible ones healed the fastest. I don't even know how many wounds are in my heart, but I feel it meltin' every day I spend here – sandwiched between mama and papa, takin' long walks, reading letters from other dogs, or just runnin' around the yard, feelin' like I belong, like I'm worthy, loved, and needed.

A person needs a dog, and a dog needs their person, or ideally, their fam. Big shoutout to the angels at [Ulubele](https://ulubele.org/) for takin' care of me, for the love and hugs you gave, thanks for helpin' my fam find me, and thanks for helpin' my other bros and sisters too.

### May every lil' creature find their fam!

With gratitude and joy, lookin' ahead with confidence,

Gerda
