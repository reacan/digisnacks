A little video I made last year, showcasing the three steps of a Digital Forensic Examination: **Processing**, **Analysis** and **Reporting**, in a mock case setting. 

The mock case is about analyzing a computer image, finding certain files based on their hash values and exploring the computer image in general.

If you have ever wondered about how digital evidence is being processed an analyzed then this video could be of interest to you.
