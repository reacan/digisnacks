#### What is Bashbot?

Bashbot is a script that allows you to interact with an AI-powered chatbot from the Linux terminal. The chatbot is a Cloudflare Worker that is set up to use the [deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct-awq](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct-awq/) LLM. 


#### Why I created Bashbot?

I spend quite a lot of time in the Linux terminal and it is very handy to be able to pass some quick querries to an AI directly from the terminal.

#### Want to try out Bashbot?

You can find the script along with an instruction on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/reacan/bashbot).
