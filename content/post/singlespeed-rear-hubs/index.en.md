I like singlespeed bicycles because they are easy to maintain and fun to ride. As the stock hubs on my bikes wore out I managed to get myself two premium singlespeed hubs as a replacement. I think it was around 2017 when I got these hubs, and they are still going strong, regular cleanup and chain swapping is the only service that they have seen. The only change I've noticed is that they have become less noisy.

**The good:**

* Female axle;
* Durable and lightweight;
* Easy to maintain, comes apart like lego.

**Not so good:**

* Noisy.
