#### About the experiment:

* One of the most interesting IT endeavours I've been involved in recently;
* Chatbot was created using Cloudflare Workers;
* It uses the [Mistral 7B LLM](https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b/) (mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1).

#### Some things I'd like to try:

* Implement settings funcionality to switch between different LLM's;
* Settings functionality to set/define the functions and personality of the chatbot;
* Persisting user sessions by using _Cloudflare Workers KV_ thus granting the chatbot a "memory".
