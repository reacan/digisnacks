This is a bilingual [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) site themed by [Cupper](https://github.com/zwbetz-gh/cupper-hugo-theme).

I have made a couple of modifications to the original Cupper theme, to name a few:

* Implemented a language switcher and placed it under the logo;
* Moved the theme switcher button under the logo;
* The theme is applied automatically based on the users preference;
* Implemented the [quizdown](https://github.com/bonartm/quizdown-js) shortcode.
