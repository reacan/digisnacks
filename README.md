This is a bilingual Hugo (gohugo.io) site themed by Cupper (https://github.com/zwbetz-gh/cupper-hugo-theme).
I have made two modifications to the original Cupper theme (apart from modding the logo ^^):

Language switcher under the logo.
Dark/Light button under the logo.

If you need an example for a simple, bilingual Hugo site, you've got it here ;)
