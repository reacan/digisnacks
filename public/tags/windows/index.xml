      <description>As more and more domain users sign in on a particular device, the more cluttered the drive becomes. Eventually new users are unable to sign in because the hard drive is simply out of free space.&#xA;If you simply delete domain user&amp;rsquo;s folder from C:\Users the user will never be able to sign in to his profile on that particular device &amp;ndash; he will be signed in to a temporary user account.</description>

Also it gives you the opportunity to effectively try out and test new things in a controlled environment. Something went wrong? Rollback the changes and try again.&#xA;Debian host with Windows 7/10/11 &amp;amp; MacOS Catalina guests The above screenshot might be a little bit misleading in the context of this article, because virtualizing MacOS images is not something that can be easily and commonly done.</description>
