      <description>I like singlespeed bicycles because they are easy to maintain and fun to ride. As the stock hubs on my bikes wore out I managed to get myself two premium singlespeed hubs as a replacement. I think it was around 2017 when I got these hubs, and they are still going strong, regular cleanup and chain swapping is the only service that they have seen. The only change I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed is that they have become less noisy.</description>

      <description>Your browser does not support the video tag. Gerda is a natural born marathon runner, it is one of her favorite things to do. She can run in this pace without stopping for about 7 kilometers straight. I only pedal the bike when we have to go uphill or when the terrain gets difficult.&#xA;She behaves herself precisely like Vinny Found this video on Telegram the other day.&#xA;Your browser does not support the video tag.</description>

      <description>A little backstory As long as I remember myself I&amp;rsquo;ve always been an avid cyclist. But I was never really bothered by the technical aspects of cycling. I knew the basics – how to fix a flat tire, adjust the brakes, lube the chain, etc., and it was enough for me. For more complex repairs I would simply take my bike to the local bike shop.&#xA;In 2016 I got seriously drawn into bicycle mechanics I made a career change and the salary at my new job was nearly half of what I used to make, so I decided to give up driving a car in favor of cycling.</description>
