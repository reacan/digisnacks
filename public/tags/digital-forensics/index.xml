      <description>I often virtualize computer images for the purposes of analysis, testing and troubleshooting. It is very fun as you can get the feel of what the user actually experienced when working with the machine. Also it gives you the opportunity to effectively try out and test new things in a controlled environment. Something went wrong? Rollback the changes and try again.&#xA;Debian host with Windows 7/10/11 &amp;amp; MacOS Catalina guests The above screenshot might be a little bit misleading in the context of this article, because virtualizing MacOS images is not something that can be easily and commonly done.</description>

      <description>Sumuri Sumuri is a US-based company that is providing forensic software and hardware solutions. They are perhaps best known for their &amp;ldquo;TALINO&amp;rdquo; series of laptops, computers and servers and their MacOS imaging tool &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;RECON ITR&amp;rdquo;. Sumuri positions itself as a community-conscious company outlining honor, integrity, loyalty, positive attitude, dedication and altruism as their core values.&#xA;What is awesome about Sumuri is that not only they talk the talk, but they also walk the walk.</description>

      <description>They say Debian runs on anything&amp;hellip; Perfect for use as a live boot system Live boot systems come in handy in troubleshooting hardware, examining and manipulating systems and exporting information.&#xA;Forensics and security focused Linux distributions There are numerous forensics and security focused Linux distributions out there, to name a few &amp;ndash; Kali Linux, Parrot OS, CAINE Linux, Tsurugi Linux, Sumuri&amp;rsquo;s PALADIN. All these Linux distributions are based on Debian or Ubuntu (which is based on Debian).</description>

      <title>Analyzing Apache access logs</title>

      <description>In this article I will demonstrate how to quickly gain some insights on Apache webserver&amp;rsquo;s access logs using GNU/Linux and Bash: filtering unique IP&amp;rsquo;s, top IP&amp;rsquo;s and IP&amp;rsquo;s by country.&#xA;Example log files: Don&amp;rsquo;t have any logs, but want to test out the below commands? Here you go:&#xA;access_1.log&#xA;access_2.log&#xA;access_3.log&#xA;How many unique IP&amp;rsquo;s are in the access logs? Props to Steven Vona for the grep syntax!&#xA;cat access_* | grep -E -o &amp;#34;(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?</description>

      <title>Password recovery with Hashcat</title>

      <description>The world&amp;rsquo;s fastest password cracker That is according to the tool&amp;rsquo;s website. The actual speed depends on factors like the hardware, the hash algorithm, and the complexity of the password. In this article I will attempt to crack the password of a Microsoft Word document using a regular laptop without a dedicated GPU.&#xA;Getting started Installing Hashcat on Debian GNU/Linux or its derrivatives is very straight forward:&#xA;apt install hashcat For Hashcat to successfully detect your CPU you may also need to install OpenCL drivers.</description>

      <description>A little video I made last year, showcasing the three steps of a Digital Forensic Examination: Processing, Analysis and Reporting, in a mock case setting.&#xA;The mock case is about analyzing a computer image, finding certain files based on their hash values and exploring the computer image in general.&#xA;If you have ever wondered about how digital evidence is being processed an analyzed then this video could be of interest to you.</description>

      <title>The Sleuthkit</title>

      <description>The Sleuth Kit (TSK) is a popular open-source software library and collection of command-line digital forensic tools. The Sleuth Kit allows forensic analysts and investigators to analyze disk images as well as live disks and to perform in-depth analysis of file systems.&#xA;TSK is my go-to tool for performing the initial analysis of images and live disk devices. In the following post I will demonstrate how to use TSK to quickly check disk images or live disk devices.</description>

      <description>Today I will share my take on performing forensic disk imaging using a Linux operating system.&#xA;I use Debian but my approach can be reproduced on any distribution that uses systemd as the init system.&#xA;Preparing the operating system Ideally forensic imaging should be done using hardware write-blockers, but if that is not an option, Linux operating system can be set up in a way to perform imaging in a forensically sound manner.</description>

      <description>Today I would like to introduce you to a free and open source digital forensics tool that, in my opinion, is on par with its commercial counterparts – Digital Evidence Processor and Indexer (DEPI), or perhaps better known by its Portuguese name – Indexador e Processador de Evidências Digitais (IPED).&#xA;The industry I&amp;rsquo;ve had the chance to work with some of the industries most recognized commercial tools, to name a few – EnCase Forensic, Magnet AXIOM, BelkaSoft Evidence Center.</description>
