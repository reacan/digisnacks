      <description>What is Bashbot? Bashbot is a script that allows you to interact with an AI-powered chatbot from the Linux terminal. The chatbot is a Cloudflare Worker that is set up to use the deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct-awq LLM.&#xA;Why I created Bashbot? I spend quite a lot of time in the Linux terminal and it is very handy to be able to pass some quick querries to an AI directly from the terminal.</description>

      <description>About the analysis I sought to exercise my data analysis skills with an intriguing dataset. I wanted to focus on data analysis rather than data collection, so I needed interesting and readily accessible data. It turns out that the KNAB party finance database offers the convenience of extracting and storing all the information using just a web browser. To preserve all the information, I needed five iterations due to the large volume of data, dividing the information by years.</description>

      <title>An experiment with an AI chatbot</title>

      <description> About the experiment: One of the most interesting IT endeavours I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved in recently; Chatbot was created using Cloudflare Workers; It uses the Mistral 7B LLM (mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1). Some things I&amp;rsquo;d like to try: Implement settings funcionality to switch between different LLM&amp;rsquo;s; Settings functionality to set/define the functions and personality of the chatbot; Persisting user sessions and granting the chatbot a &amp;ldquo;memory&amp;rdquo;. </description>

      <description>Recently I was tasked with writting a Bash script that would querry IP addresses from a file and return their corresponding abuse contact e-mail addresses.&#xA;The script that I initially came up with did not perform as expected. I remembered hearing stories about Chat GPT being able to generate decent code, so I decided to finally try it out.&#xA;I was very amazed to say the least, my mind was blown.</description>
