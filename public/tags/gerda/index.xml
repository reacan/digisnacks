      <description>Your browser does not support the video tag. Gerda is a natural born marathon runner, it is one of her favorite things to do. She can run in this pace without stopping for about 7 kilometers straight. I only pedal the bike when we have to go uphill or when the terrain gets difficult.&#xA;She behaves herself precisely like Vinny Found this video on Telegram the other day.&#xA;Your browser does not support the video tag.</description>

      <description>Yo, what&amp;rsquo;s good to all my peeps who care &amp;lsquo;bout my destiny! It&amp;rsquo;s been a little over a year since I&amp;rsquo;ve been rollin&amp;rsquo; with this fam. Back then, rollin&amp;rsquo; into the big green yard, I was kinda scared of all that space and freedom, but my two-legged crew was all hype, encouragin&amp;rsquo; me to explore the yard.&#xA;Start was tough for all of us, filled with challenges, but they pushed me to explore, told me to trust, and every day through their actions, they showed me how wanted and loved I am.</description>
